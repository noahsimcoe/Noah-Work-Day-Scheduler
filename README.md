# Noah's Work Day Scheduler
Challenge 05 - Third Party API's

## Description
I built this project to demonstrate my understanding of how Third Party API's can be used to make building an application much easier. I proved that I was able to successfully link API's to the html source code on my own application, and that I was also to write executable code that simplifies my application.

When building this project I refined my understanding of what "this" is in JavaScript, and how it can be used to target/change specific elements among a list of elements on an application. I also learned a lot about how much jQuery can help with trimming down the amount of code that is required for the same exact functionality in regular JavaScript. Working to convert my regular JavaScript code to jQuery helped me memorize the patterns it uses and will provide long term benefits when I use it again in the future. While working on this project I also used Day.js, which is an API that helps you use times/dates and allows you to format that information.

## Installation
This project is deployed on GitHub Pages and available to view.

## Usage
This project is used to create an organized schedule of someone's workday (9AM - 5PM). The user can select different hours indivudally and add tasks to them that will save to the user's local storage once the save button has been clicked. The user can also view which hours of the day are either past/present/future based off of the color coding provided on each hour block.

## Deployed Application

Additionally, here is a screenshot of what it looks like.
